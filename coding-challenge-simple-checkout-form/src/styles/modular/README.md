# Why there is this folder?
This modular files are created because sometimes we might want to not only import the bulma files but also alter some 'element/component variables' variables in them. To see more about Bulma's variable structure, see [here](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/concepts/)

## Important Note
**ALWAYS** import the modular files existing in this folder **AFTER** importing the [main sass file of the project](../_main.sass)
